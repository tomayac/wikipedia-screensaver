[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/tomayac/wikipedia-screensaver.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A speaking Wikipedia screensaver based on the Wikimedia [EventStreams](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/EventStreams) service.
See and hear it in action with the [demo](https://tomayac.github.io/wikipedia-screensaver/dist/)
(on mobile devices a user gesture is necessary for audio to work).
